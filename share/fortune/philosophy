My depression is the most faithful mistress I have known - no wonder,
then, that I return the love.

Judaism, even if you didn't believe in it, plugged you right in to a dynamo
of ideas and beliefs that were, upon examination, not very American.... [T]he
perennially juvenile nation that interpreted divine election as invitation
to grow big and hairy had very little in common with the perpetually aged
faith that understood divine election to be a burden that can never be
shaken off. Jews erred in the wilderness, forever looking for the promised
land; Americans were expanding their city on the hill, the promised land
reincarnate. America was a pledge to optimism; Judaism, to borrow a phrase
from Leonard Cohen, was a manual for living with defeat.

[W]e don’t assume that every unsolved murder has to have been God smiting
the victim – so unanswered questions aren’t a good reason to assume a
divine being as the answer.

...because this journey is not subject to the same conditions as others;
for in them some distinctly understood track and inquiries made of the
natives make it impossible for us to go wrong, but here the most beaten
and frequented tracks are those which lead us most astray.

It is harmful to follow the march of those who go before us, and since
everyone had rather believe another than form his own opinion, we never
pass a deliberate judgment upon life, but some traditional error always
entangles us and brings us to ruin, and we perish because we follow other
men’s examples: we should be cured of this if we were to disengage
ourselves from the herd; but as it is, the mob is ready to fight against
reason in defence of its own mistake.

Let us therefore inquire, not what is most commonly done, but what is best
for us to do....

How much truth is contained in something can be best determined by making
it thoroughly laughable and then watching to see how much joking around it
can take. For truth is a matter that can withstand mockery, that is
freshened by any ironic gesture directed at it. Whatever cannot withstand
satire is false.
    --Peter Sloterdijk, _Critique of Cynical Reason_
