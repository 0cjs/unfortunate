My depression is the most faithful mistress I have known - no wonder,

Judaism, even if you didn't believe in it, plugged you right in to a dynamo
of ideas and beliefs that were, upon examination, not very American.... [T]he
perennially juvenile nation that interpreted divine election as invitation
to grow big and hairy had very little in common with the perpetually aged
faith that understood divine election to be a burden that can never be
shaken off. Jews erred in the wilderness, forever looking for the promised
land; Americans were expanding their city on the hill, the promised land
reincarnate. America was a pledge to optimism; Judaism, to borrow a phrase
from Leonard Cohen, was a manual for living with defeat.

[W]e don’t assume that every unsolved murder has to have been God smiting
the victim – so unanswered questions aren’t a good reason to assume a
divine being as the answer.

We all love ourselves more than other people,
but care more about their opinion than our own.
