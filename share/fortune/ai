Once that first blush fades, it becomes clear that ChatGPT doesn’t actually
know anything—instead, it outputs compositions that simulate knowledge
through persuasive structure.

Q to ChatGPT: Where is New Scotland Yard?
A: New Scotland Yard is located at 8-10 Broadway, Westminster, London,
   England. It was the headquarters of the Metropolitan Police Service
   (MPS) from 1890 to 1967, and the name "New Scotland Yard" was also used
   as a metonym for the MPS itself. However, since 2017, the MPS moved to a
   new location, Metropolitan Police Service at Curtis Green, London,
   England.
(Actually, New Scotland Yard was at Embankment from 1890 to 1967, 8-10
Broadway from 1967 to 2017, and moved back to Embankment, to the Curtis
Green building adjacent to the previous headquarters, in 2017.)
