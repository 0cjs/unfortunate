Dr. Evil: The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
Therapist (Carrie Fisher): Oh no, please, please, let's hear about your
childhood.
Dr Evil: Very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly
self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy
and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French
prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize,
he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the
question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the
sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane
lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In
the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in
a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age
of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian
named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing
like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.
Therapist: You know, we have to stop.

Information Wants To Be Free. Information also wants to be expensive.
Information wants to be free because it has become so cheap to
distribute, copy, and recombine---too cheap to meter. It wants to be
expensive because it can be immeasurably valuable to the recipient. That
tension will not go away. It leads to endless wrenching debate about
price, copyright, 'intellectual property', the moral rightness of casual
distribution, because each round of new devices makes the tension worse,
not better.

I really am amused by this turn of discussion, because advocates of
copyleft are in precisely the same position.  Their *amoral*,
objective analysis of human behavior is that some humans will try to
restrict the software freedom of others, and the vast majority of
those others will see no profit in resisting.  Therefore, a free
software license that *deliberately restricts* licensees' freedom is
carefully designed, a profoundly moral act.

In fact, even in the presence of copyright or patent, an individual
always has the right to choose only software under a free license, at
the cost of giving up proprietary software, thus preserving his own
freedom.  Therefore copyleft, restricting the freedom to bargain away
the "four freedoms" in return for something else of value, can be
justified morally *only* by reference to the software "ecosystem", ie,
emergent effects of your use of non-free software on my freedom.

My feeling with the bad groups is that coming into office hours, they've
already decided what they're going to do and everything I say is being
put through an internal process in their heads, which either desperately
tries to munge what I've said into something that conforms with their
decision or just outright dismisses it and creates a rationalization
for doing so. They may not even be conscious of this process but that's
what I think is happening when you say something to bad groups and they
have that glazed over look. I don't think it's confusion or lack of

the work of salvation? Is the last word sweet? Is all 'yes, yes' in

Doesn't the very 'seriousness' that we attribute to life mean that

sacrifices somewhere, and that something permanently drastic and bitter

Americans are pushy, obnoxious, neurotic, crass--anything and everything--
the full catastrophe as our friend Zorba might say. Canadians are none of
that. The way _you_ [an Indian] might fear a cow sitting down in the middle
of the street during rush hour, that's how _I_ fear Canadians. To
Canadians, everyone is equal. Joni Mitchell is interchangeable with a
secretary at open-mic night. Frank Gehry is no greater than a hack pumping
out McMansions on AutoCAD. John Candy is no funnier than Uncle Lou when he
gets a couple of beers in him. No wonder the only Canadians anyone's ever
heard of are the ones who have gotten the hell out. Anyone with talent who
stayed would be flattened under an avalanche of equality. The thing
Canadians don't understand is that some people are extraordinary and should
be treated as such.

It turns out that formal and informal told us more about a participant's
perception of social anxiety in a meeting than it did about the type or
format of a meeting. I experience stand-ups and interviews as informal,
largely because I'm in charge and am confident of my role in these
meetings. I doubt everyone I interview considers it an informal chat,
though, and I imagine our stand-up may feel pretty uptight to someone who
wasn't used to it.

Excerpts from the Fisher Scientific material safety data sheet for water:
4. First-aid measures
    • Eye Contact: Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least
      15 minutes.
    • Skin Contact: Rinse skin with water.
6. Accidental release measures
    • Environmental Precautions: Should not be released into the environment.
8. Exposure controls / personal protection
    • Engineering Measures: ensure that eyewash stations and safety showers
      are close to the workstation location.
9. Physical and chemical properties
    • Flammability or explosive limits:
      • Upper: No data available
      • Lower: No data available
    • Autoignition Temperature: No information available
12. Ecological Information
    • Ecotoxicity: Do not empty into drains.
    • Persistence and Degradability: Miscible with water. Persistence is
      unlikely based on information available.
    • Mobility: Will likely be mobile in the environment due to its water
      solubility.
15. Regulatory information
    • CWA (Clean Water Act): Not applicable
