Dr. Evil: The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
Therapist (Carrie Fisher): Oh no, please, please, let's hear about your
childhood.
Dr Evil: Very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly
self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy
and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French
prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize,
he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the
question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the
sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane
lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In
the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in
a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age
of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian
named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing
like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.

Information Wants To Be Free. Information also wants to be expensive.
Information wants to be free because it has become so cheap to
distribute, copy, and recombine---too cheap to meter. It wants to be
expensive because it can be immeasurably valuable to the recipient. That
tension will not go away. It leads to endless wrenching debate about
price, copyright, 'intellectual property', the moral rightness of casual
distribution, because each round of new devices makes the tension worse,

I really am amused by this turn of discussion, because advocates of
copyleft are in precisely the same position.  Their *amoral*,
objective analysis of human behavior is that some humans will try to
restrict the software freedom of others, and the vast majority of
those others will see no profit in resisting.  Therefore, a free
software license that *deliberately restricts* licensees' freedom is
carefully designed, a profoundly moral act.

In fact, even in the presence of copyright or patent, an individual
always has the right to choose only software under a free license, at
the cost of giving up proprietary software, thus preserving his own
freedom.  Therefore copyleft, restricting the freedom to bargain away
the "four freedoms" in return for something else of value, can be
justified morally *only* by reference to the software "ecosystem", ie,
emergent effects of your use of non-free software on my freedom.

put through an internal process in their heads, which either desperately
tries to munge what I've said into something that conforms with their
decision or just outright dismisses it and creates a rationalization
for doing so. They may not even be conscious of this process but that's
what I think is happening when you say something to bad groups and they

A ferry pilot brought a plane to town at night, tied it down at the
rural airport, and was to meet the prospective buyer the next morning.
The buyer arrived at the strip early the next morning, and while
waiting for the ferry pilot, poked around the locked plane. Eventually
something possessed him to rotate the prop through manually. Normally
that would not have been a problem, except the magneto switch in the
aircraft was "open" in the off position, which meant that both
magnetos were hot. This was likely not noticed because not everyone
does a magneto "ground" check in the off position during their run-up
process. However, if the mixture idle-cutoff were in the cutoff
position, there would not be fuel available in the carburetor to
ignite, except for some reason (such as the ferry pilot extracting his
RON bag in the dark) the mixture was nearly full rich. Normally this
might have resulted in the engine firing, or even starting and idling.
Again, this morning, things were not normal. The RON bag, extracted in
darkness by the ferry pilot not only had bumped the mixture control,
but also the throttle, so the aircraft engine faithfully roared to
full power. Fortunately the startled prospective buyer did not get hit
by the spinning prop. However, again, this was an unusual morning. As
the engine roared to life, the tiedown on the right wing broke, and
the plane pivoted on the left tiedown and swung approximately 180
degrees until the prop was buried into the fuel tank of an adjacent
Cessna. Av gas was all over the place. One thing went right that
morning, in that the avgas did not ignite and there was no fireball.
Unfortunately, the day was not over, yet. After missing the spinning
prop and not getting butchered by the surprise of his life, and then
dodging a partially freed airplane, the buyer watched in horror as 40
gallons of avgas was sprayed over a running engine, as it came to a
somewhat abrupt stop, the prop buried in someone else's wing. At that
point he started running up the hill to the FBO to get help, and
collapsed to the ground and died of a heart attack.

"Bullion is the accessory of war, and not of peaceful trade." The
reason is simple. Commodity money, particularly in the form of gold
and silver, is distinguished from credit money most of all by one
spectacular feature: it can be stolen.

Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir menâs blood and
probably themselves will not be realized. Make big plans; aim high in
hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded
will never die, but long after we are gone be a living thing,
asserting itself with ever-growing insistency. Remember that our sons
and our grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us. Let
your watchword be order and your beacon beauty.

Even for an Apple executive, GassÃ©e's complacency [about Microsoft
Windows] seemed extreme. Nonetheless, it was fed by an ever-widening
circle of Macintosh devotees and syncophants. Like Pepsi, where
Sculley had been an executive, Apple was selling a product wrapped in
a dream: buy a Macintosh and it will make you cool. As in sports car
ads, the models in Apple's advertising tacitly posted the question: Do
you want to look like me? Buy this product and you will.

Euclid alone has looked on Beauty bare.
Let all who prate of Beauty hold their peace,
And lay them prone upon the earth and cease
To ponder on themselves, the while they stare
At nothing, intricately drawn nowhere
In shapes of shifting lineage; let geese
Gabble and hiss, but heroes seek release
From dusty bondage into luminous air.
O blinding hour, O holy, terrible day,
When first the shaft into his vision shone
Of light anatomized! Euclid alone
Has looked on Beauty bare. Fortunate they
Who, though once only and then but far away,
Have heard her massive sandal set on stone.

Anti-Catholicism has always been the pornography of the Puritan. Whereas
the anti-Masons had envisaged drinking bouts and had entertained themselves
with sado-masochistic fantasies about the actual enforcement of grisly
Masonic oaths, the anti-Catholics invented an immense lore about libertine
priests, the confessional as an opportunity for seduction, licentious
convents and monasteries.
