Anti-Catholicism has always been the pornography of the Puritan. Whereas
the anti-Masons had envisaged drinking bouts and had entertained themselves
with sado-masochistic fantasies about the actual enforcement of grisly
Masonic oaths, the anti-Catholics invented an immense lore about libertine
priests, the confessional as an opportunity for seduction, licentious
convents and monasteries.

The tide turned decisively in the 13th century with the theological genius
Thomas Aquinas denouncing homosexual acts as "against nature." All sex -
heterosexual and homosexual - was to be reserved only for married couples
open to procreation, and any other sexual activity was a grave sin.
Homosexuals, in the new theology, were part of nature â€” many had noticed
homosexual behavior in the animal kingdom, particularly among hares and
hyenas - but they were also somehow contrary to nature. Aquinas never
resolved this paradox. Neither has the [Catholic] church.

Scientists do not join hands every Saturday or Sunday and sing, "Yes,
gravity is real! I know gravity is real! I will have faith! I will be
strong! I believe in my heart that what goes up, up, up must come down,
down, down. Amen!" If they did, we would think they were pretty insecure
about the concept.

Your Christians are so unlike your Christ.

The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character
in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving
control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic,
homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential,
megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully.

Wally: God hates me.
Kevin: No he doesn't; he loves you. He just doesn't know how to express it.
