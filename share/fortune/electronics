We've just seen that an infinite ladder network of infinitesimally small
inductors and capacitors has a purely real input impedance over an infinite
bandwidth. Although structures that are infinitely long are somewhat
inconvenient to realize, we can always terminate a finite length of line in
its characteristic impedance. Energy, being relatively easy to fool, cannot
distinguish between real transmission line and a resistor equal to the
characteristic impedance.
