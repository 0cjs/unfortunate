The complexity of these systems makes it impossible for them to run without
multiple flaws being present....
  After accident reviews nearly always note that the system has a history of
prior 'proto-accidents' that nearly generated catastrophe. Arguments that
these degraded conditions should have been recognized before the overt
accident are usually predicated on naïve notions of system performance.
System operations are dynamic, with components (organizational, human,
technical) failing and being replaced continuously.

7. Post-accident attribution to a 'root cause' is fundamentally wrong.
   Because overt failure requires multiple faults, there is no isolated
'cause' of an accident. There are multiple contributors to accidents. Each of
these is necessarily insufficient in itself to create an accident. Only
jointly are these causes sufficient to create an accident. Indeed, it is the
linking of these causes together that creates the circumstances required for
the accident. Thus, no isolation of the 'root cause' of an accident is
possible. The evaluations based on such reasoning as 'root cause' do not
reflect a technical understanding of the nature of failure but rather the
social, cultural need to blame specific, localized forces or events for
outcomes.

..._ex post facto_ accident analysis of human performance is inaccurate. The
outcome knowledge poisons the ability of after-accident observers to recreate
the view of practitioners before the accident of those same factors....
_Hindsight bias remains the primary obstacle to accident investigation,
especially when expert human performance is involved._

10. All practitioner actions are gambles.
    After accidents, the overt failure often appears to have been inevitable
and the practitioner’s actions as blunders or deliberate willful disregard of
certain impending failure. But all practitioner actions are actually gambles,
that is, acts that take place in the face of uncertain outcomes. The degree
of uncertainty may change from moment to moment. That practitioner actions
are gambles appears clear after accidents; in general, post hoc analysis
regards these gambles as poor ones. But the converse: that successful
outcomes are also the result of gambles; is not widely appreciated.

15. Views of ‘cause’ limit the effectiveness of defenses against future events.
  Post-accident remedies for “human error” are usually predicated on
obstructing activities that can “cause” accidents. These end-of-the-chain
measures do little to reduce the likelihood of further accidents. In fact
that likelihood of an identical accident is already extraordinarily low
because the pattern of latent failures changes constantly. Instead of
increasing safety, post-accident remedies usually increase the coupling and
complexity of the system. This increases the potential number of latent
failures and also makes the detection and blocking of accident trajectories
more difficult.
