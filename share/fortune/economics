"Bullion is the accessory of war, and not of peaceful trade." The
reason is simple. Commodity money, particularly in the form of gold
and silver, is distinguished from credit money most of all by one
spectacular feature: it can be stolen.

Chicago Schoolers had a range of response to such criticism [of their
assumptions about human individual's economic behavior].... The prize
for chutzpah went to Milton Friedman, here as elsewhere a profoundly
malign influence, who claimed that this lack of realism was in fact a
virtue, and actually what made economics extra scientific.

To prove that Wall Street is an early omen of movements still to come in
GNP, commentators quote economic studies alleging that market downturns
predicted four out of the last five recessions. That is an understatement.
Wall Street indexes predicted nine out of the last five recessions! And its
mistakes were beauties.

I want the courage, when asked to pick between two obviously different-
sized pieces of cake, to look the other person in the eyes and very
deliberately pick the bigger one.

Now, I finally realise that the money I used to make [as an investment
banker] was not really wealth, but 'claims' on wealth. Actual wealth is the
visceral things we need to be 'well', such as good food, shelter, transport,
health, opportunities for play, access to nature. Money is a claim - a unit
of power - to bring these things into our life, thanks to the efforts of
other people and the provisions of the natural world. Making money without
making this true wealth serves only the money makers, not society.
