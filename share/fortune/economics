To prove that Wall Street is an early omen of movements still to come in
GNP, commentators quote economic studies alleging that market downturns
predicted four out of the last five recessions. That is an understatement.
Wall Street indexes predicted nine out of the last five recessions! And its
mistakes were beauties.

Now, I finally realise that the money I used to make [as an investment
banker] was not really wealth, but 'claims' on wealth. Actual wealth is the
visceral things we need to be 'well', such as good food, shelter, transport,
health, opportunities for play, access to nature. Money is a claim - a unit
of power - to bring these things into our life, thanks to the efforts of
other people and the provisions of the natural world. Making money without
making this true wealth serves only the money makers, not society.
