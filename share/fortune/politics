Freedom only for the supporters of the government, only for the members of
a party – however numerous they may be – is no freedom at all. Freedom is
always the freedom of the one who thinks differently. Not because of the
fanaticism of "justice", but rather because all that is instructive,
wholesome, and purifying in political freedom depends on this essential
characteristic, and its effects cease to work when "freedom" becomes a
privilege.

To be sure, every democratic institution has its faults and limitations,
which it has in common with all human institutions. But the remedy
discovered by Lenin and Trotsky, the abolition of democracy, is worse than
the evil it is supposed to cure, for it shuts off the lifespring from which
can come the cure for all the inadequacies of social institutions.

There was nothing that Marx feared so much as the degeneration of his
school into a rigid sect....
To Marx there was no ultimate knowledge, only an infinite process of
learning. Therefore, his own theory is not to be conceive as a collection
of tenets which we must accept on faith. Marxism itself is nothing but a
definite process of learning... This method itself, which Marx and Engels
called the materialist conception of history, is not unalterable. It is
constantly being improved, like a machine, through continued gain in
experience accumulated in its application.

The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor
to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.
