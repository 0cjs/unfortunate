Freedom only for the supporters of the government, only for the members of
a party – however numerous they may be – is no freedom at all. Freedom is
always the freedom of the one who thinks differently. Not because of the
fanaticism of "justice", but rather because all that is instructive,
wholesome, and purifying in political freedom depends on this essential
characteristic, and its effects cease to work when "freedom" becomes a
privilege.

To be sure, every democratic institution has its faults and limitations,
which it has in common with all human institutions. But the remedy
discovered by Lenin and Trotsky, the abolition of democracy, is worse than
the evil it is supposed to cure, for it shuts off the lifespring from which
can come the cure for all the inadequacies of social institutions.

There was nothing that Marx feared so much as the degeneration of his
school into a rigid sect....
To Marx there was no ultimate knowledge, only an infinite process of
learning. Therefore, his own theory is not to be conceive as a collection
of tenets which we must accept on faith. Marxism itself is nothing but a
definite process of learning... This method itself, which Marx and Engels
called the materialist conception of history, is not unalterable. It is
constantly being improved, like a machine, through continued gain in
experience accumulated in its application.

When plunder becomes a way of life for a group of men in a society,
over the course of time they create for themselves a legal system that
authorizes it and a moral code that glorifies it.

The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest exercises in
moral philosophy; that is, the search for a superior moral justification
for selfishness.
    --J.K. Galbreath

The modern conservative is not even especially modern. He is engaged,
on the contrary, in one of man's oldest, best financed, most
applauded, and, on the whole, least successful exercises in moral
philosophy. That is the search for a superior moral justification for
selfishness. It is an exercise which always involves a certain number
of internal contradictions and even a few absurdities. The
conspicuously wealthy turn up urging the character-building value of
privation for the poor. The man who has struck it rich in minerals,
oil, or other bounties of nature is found explaining the debilitating
effect of unearned income from the state. The corporate executive who
is a superlative success as an organization man weighs in on the evils
of bureaucracy. Federal aid to education is feared by those who live
in suburbs that could easily forgo this danger, and by people whose
children are in public schools. Socialized medicine is condemned by
men emerging from Walter Reed Hospital. Social Security is viewed with
alarm by those who have the comfortable cushion of an inherited
income. Those who are immediately threatened by public efforts to meet
their needs — whether widows, small farmers, hospitalized veterans, or
the unemployed — are almost always oblivious to the danger.

Some comrades do not like to think much about difficulties. But
difficulties are facts; we must recognize as many difficulties as
there are and should not adopt a "policy of non-recognition". We must
recognize difficulties, analyse them and combat them. There are no
straight roads in the world; we must be prepared to follow a road that
twists and turns and not try to get things on the cheap.

Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: there must be

The truth is that the elite world that Epstein ascended into, the one I
tapped into by way of the black book, is populated with hordes of
loathsome, boring, untalented people living their bumbling, idiotic lives
while just so happening to wield some share of the preposterous global
bounty that he and the rest were after. For all the mystery surrounding
Epstein's fortune, its existence is hardly more inscrutable than the wealth
of any of his other billionaire peers. He earned it the same way they all
did, which is to say precisely not at all.
    This wasn't some masterful hack into the global aristocracy. It's what
everyone does. It's what the whole thing is. There is no scam here. It's
grifters grifting grifters all the way down.

In fact, the likeliest reason why so many of us care so little about
politics is that modern politicians make us sad, hurt us deep down in ways
that are hard even to name, much less talk about.

...if you're a true-blue, market-savvy Young Voter, the only thing you're
certain to feel about John McCain's campaign is a very modern and American
type of ambivalence, a sort of iterior war between your deep need to

there's nothing left anywhere but sales and salesmen.

[Regarding fear of speaking due to "cancel culture":] There have always
been codes of silence. At every time in history, to have access to people's
true thoughts, one needed to learn a community’s codes and go deeper than
superficial conversation. But today many people feel disoriented because
the code is changing very fast and few understand where the changes come
from. It used to be that if I didn't offend the chief of the village or the
gods of the village, I could have freedom in other aspects. Now the source
of power is less clear. It is globalized. You can say something about
someone thousands of miles away and have instant repercussions.
  And it is democratized: So many more people, especially young people,
exercise power in controlling these public conversations. With their savvy
and their numbers, they can demand consequences for certain kinds of
speech. But their code is always changing, often very quickly and
unpredictably, so many people feel that until they understand the new
equilibrium, they must be circumspect observers and cannot talk freely.
