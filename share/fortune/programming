Central in the final design was the goal to be comprehensive while being

convenience for the programmer as a design goal. Thus, support for more

Though OOP came from many motivations, two were central. The large scale
one was to find a better module scheme for complex systems involving

version of assignment, and then try to eliminate it altogether.

state, but to eliminate state-oriented metaphors from programming.

On October 11, 1963, my suggestion was to pass on a request of our
customers to relax the ALGOL 60 rule of compulsory declaration of
variable names and adopt some reasonable default convention such
as that of FORTRAN. I was astonished by the polite but firm rejection
of this seemingly innocent suggestion: It was pointed out that the
redundancy of ALGOL 60 was the best protection against programming
and coding errors which could be extremely expensive to detect in
a running program and even more expensive not to. The story of the
Mariner space rocket to Venus, lost because of the lack of compulsory
declarations in FORTRAN, was not to be published until later. I
was eventually persuaded of the need to design programming notations
so as to maximize the number of errors which cannot be made, or if
made, can be reliably detected at compile time. Perhaps this would
make the text of programs longer.  Never mind! Wouldn't you be
delighted if your Fairy Godmother offered to wave her wand over
your program to remove all its errors and only made the condition
that you should write out and key in your whole program three times!
The way to shorten programs is to use procedures, not to omit vital
declarative information.

In software development, questions about the less able programmer
really come down to trying to substitute a process for intelligence,
aptitude, and experience. Apparently, a lot of people think that if we
force people to create enough UML diagrams (or whatever), have enough
reviews, and otherwise follow a detailed process, that eventually
they will figure out what they are doing and code it correctly. There
is no evidence that such approaches have worked in the past, and I
see no reason to believe they will work in the future.

The woes of software engineering are not due to lack of tools or

competence. A good designer must rely on experience; on precise,
logical thinking; and on pedantic exactness. No magic will do.
    --Niklaus Wirth, from an interview in Software Development, June 1997
%
We must be careful with terms like readable, user-friendly, and so forth.
They are vague at best, and often refer to taste and established habits.
But what is conventional need not also be convenient. In the context of
programming languages, perhaps "readable" should be replaced by "amenable
to formal reasoning." For example, mathematical formulas are hardly what we
might praise as easily readable, but they allow the formal derivation of
properties that could not be obtained from a vague, fuzzy, informal,
user-friendly circumscription.
    --Niklaus Wirth, from an interview in Software Development, June 1997
%
The wealth of features of many languages is indeed a problem rather than a
solution. A multitude of features is another consequence of the
programmers' belief that the value of a language is proportional to the
quantity of its features and facilities, bells, and whistles. However, we
know that it is better if each basic concept is represented by a single,
designated language construct. Not only does this reduce the effort of
learning, but it reduces the volume of the language's description, and
thereby the possibilities of inconsistency and of misunderstanding. Keeping
a language as simple and as regular as possible has always been a guideline
in my work; the description of Pascal took some 50 pages, Modula took 40,
and Oberon took a mere 16. This I still consider to have been genuine
progress.

When Vic Vyssotsky modified a Fortran compiler in the early 1960s he
spent a week making a correct routine very fast, and thereby
introduced a bug. The bug surfaced two years later, because the
routine _had never once been called_ in over 100,000 compilations.

I dislike the implicit declaration of lexicals because it tends to defeat
the primary use of them, namely, catching typos. It’s just too easy to
declare additional variable names by accident. It’s also too easy to
broaden the scope of a variable by accident. You might have a bunch of
separate subroutines each with their own lexical, and suddenly find that
they’re all the same variable because you accidentally used the same
variable name in the module initialization code....
  And when it comes down to it, I believe that declarations with `my`
are properly Huffman encoded.

Greatness comes from thousands of small improvements... Only in
Hollywood movies does a brilliant young mind come up with an amazing
new idea that is implemented and works perfectly the first time. In
the real world, it takes years to create an overnight success.
...
The biggest improvements come from working across silos and involving
all stakeholders. If there is no collaboration across teams, then each
team will optimize their area, often to the detriment of the
efficiency of the other teams. By working across teams, you develop
empathy and can create the most impactful changes.

When I’m trying to understand someone else’s code I tend to find the
best way is to refactor or even rewrite it. I start by just formatting
it to be the way I like. Then I start changing names that seem unclear
or poorly chosen. And then I start mucking with the structure. There’s
nothing I like better than discovering a big chunk of dead code I can
delete and not have to worry about understanding. Usually when I’m
done with that I not only have a piece of code that I think is much
better but I also can understand the original.
