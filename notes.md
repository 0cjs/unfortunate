### dijkstra

- Simplicity. Some argument about this at [wikiquote][wq dijkstra] because
  Hoare had "The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost
  simplicity" in his 1980 Turing Award lecture ["The Emperor's Old
  Clothes"][hoare80], but the transcription of 1975 [ewd498] mentions it as
  a "handwritten annotation."
- Null objection: [Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake][infoq-null]

### economics

- Friedman "only one social responsibility of business." This particular
  quote apparently from the book _Captialism and Freedom,_ but the idea is
  better known from the NYT article [A Friedman doctrine‐- The Social
  Responsibility Of Business Is to Increase Its Profits][nyt70]
  (1970-09-13). Also at [Maximizing Profits: Milton Friedman][19974].
- John Honovich quoted in Timothy McLaughlin, ["The Tech Site That Took On
  China's Surveillance State"][atl2209a], _The Atlantic._

### ideals

- José María Arizmendiarrieta quotes from _Reflections_ at [ariz].
- "Being realistic and pragmatic...." Translation in _Reflections__ is terible.
  Got a better one from @juanse_gcoop_arg in Patio Mattermost chat, but the
  current one is mine, based on Google Translate. Original:
  - Ser realistas y pragmáticos no quiere decir renunciar a los ideales, que no
    deben ser confundidos con quimeras y bellos sueños, sino aceptados como
    objetivos a realizar.

    proved to be authoritarian to some degree."
  - "The things that multiculturalists believe will help people appreciate
    and thrive in democracy—appreciating difference, talking about
    difference, displaying and applauding difference—are the very
    conditions that encourage authoritarians not to heights of tolerance,
    but to their intolerant extremes."

  Tears of a Clown"[atl2201]
