[[tomquot]] \([archive][tomquotwb]), attributing to [_The Search for Signs

### dijkstra

- Simplicity. Some argument about this at [wikiquote][wq dijkstra] because
  Hoare had "The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost
  simplicity" in his 1980 Turing Award lecture ["The Emperor's Old
  Clothes"][hoare80], but the transcription of 1975 [ewd498] mentions it as
  a "handwritten annotation."

### ideals

- José María Arizmendiarrieta quotes from _Reflections_ at [ariz].
- "Being realistic and pragmatic...." Translation in _Reflections__ is terible.
  Got a better one from @juanse_gcoop_arg in Patio Mattermost chat, but the
  current one is mine, based on Google Translate. Original:
  - Ser realistas y pragmáticos no quiere decir renunciar a los ideales, que no
    deben ser confundidos con quimeras y bellos sueños, sino aceptados como
    objetivos a realizar.

### politics

    proved to be authoritarian to some degree."
  - "The things that multiculturalists believe will help people appreciate
    and thrive in democracy—appreciating difference, talking about
    difference, displaying and applauding difference—are the very
    conditions that encourage authoritarians not to heights of tolerance,
    but to their intolerant extremes."
- Boris Johnson, "...Tory party's soul...." Quoted in _The Atlantic,_ "The
  Tears of a Clown"[atl2201]
